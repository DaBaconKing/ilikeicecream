## 📜 History & Development

- Developed alongside the A-X program that led to the A-10.  
- Initially replaced by the M61 Vulcan during prototype testing.  
- Entered service in 1977.  
- A failed attempt to mount a variant (GAU-13/A) on F-16s during Desert Storm led to poor accuracy and abandonment of the concept.

- Requires tail jack during removal to prevent aircraft tipping.  
- Uses hydraulic motors powered by dual aircraft systems.  
- Fires in short bursts (1–2 seconds) to avoid overheating.  
- Barrel life: minimum 20,000 rounds.
